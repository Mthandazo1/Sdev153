        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            The Indy Food Truck Rally began in the summer of 2020 with a simple mission: to connect the city's hungry residents with the best mobile chefs in Indiana. 
            What started as a small gathering of three trucks in a parking lot has grown into a weekly city-wide event.

        <h3>Community Mission</h3>
        <p>
            We believe in supporting small businesses. Every truck at our rally is locally owned and operated. 
            By visiting the rally, you aren't just getting a great meal—you are helping a local family achieve their culinary dreams.
        </p>

        <h3>Safety First</h3>
        <p>
            All vendors participating in the Indy Food Truck Rally are fully licensed and undergo rigorous health inspections. 
            We maintain strict cleanliness standards to ensure a safe and delicious environment for everyone.
